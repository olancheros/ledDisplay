# ledDisplay

This program simulates a numeric display of LEDs.

This program makes part of a proposed lab in the Python Essentials, a course offered by
Python Institute, and that I'm taking now thanks to Cisco Networking Academy.

The objective it's asking the user to input a positive integer number, getting as output the
number written in a LED fashion and plotted in red color. To get the output plotted in color
I'm using the **Colorama** library, that can be installed with pip.

Finally I want to pointing out that this is a good example to understand how we can use a dictionary in Python.
